### Developing ###

If you wish to work on Tipsy, you can find instructions on getting started
below.  It uses [Node](http://nodejs.org) to install and run the extension.

#### Installing Node and dependencies ####

Go to the [Node](http://nodejs.org) homepage and install for your platform.

Next, open a command line prompt and enter the project directory.  The rest of
the commands are run in that directory.

### Installing dependencies ###

Node comes packaged with a package manager that you can use to install modules.

``` bash
# Install all dependencies.
npm install
```

#### Client side dependencies ####

The third party client side assets are versioned and managed by Bower, they are
not checked in to prevent noisy diffs and conflicts.

You can read more about Bower here: http://bower.io/

They are automatically installed when you run `npm install` so typically there
is no need to manually update the dependencies.  If you find yourself changing
the dependencies, run:

``` bash
bower install
```

### Working on Chrome extension ###

To build the Chrome extension, you will need [Google
Chrome](http://chrome.com/) installed.

Once it is installed and configured you can build the extension with:

``` bash
npm run build
```

or more specifically:

``` bash
grunt chrome-extension
```

#### Loading the unpacked extension ####

The source code necessary to run the extension as unpacked lives in the
*dist/tipsy* directory and can be dragged into the Extensions tab within
Chrome.
